## About

A package to define parameter spaces consisting of mixed types (continuous, integer,
categorical) with conditions and priors. It allows for easy specification of the
parameters and their dependencies. The `ParameterSpace` object can then be used to
sample random configurations from the prior and convert any valid configuration
into a numerical representation. This numerical representation has the following
properties:

- it results in a Numpy `ndarray` of type `float64`
- transformed representation between 0 and 1 (uniform) including integers, ordinal and
  categorical parameters
- inactive parameters are masked as `numpy.nan` values

This allows to easily use optimizers that expect continuous domains to be used on more
complicated problems because `parameterspace` can convert any numerical vector
representation inside the unit hypercube into a valid configuration. The function might
not be smooth, but for robust methods (like genetic algorithms/evolutionary strategies)
this might still be valuable.

This software is a research prototype. The software is not ready for production use. It
has neither been developed nor tested for a specific use case. However, the license
conditions of the applicable Open Source licenses allow you to adapt the software to
your needs. Before using it in a safety relevant setting, make sure that the software
fulfills your requirements and adjust it according to any applicable safety standards
(e.g. ISO 26262).

## Documentation

**Visit [boschresearch.github.io/parameterspace](https://boschresearch.github.io/parameterspace/)**


## Installation

The `parameterspace` package can be installed from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org):

```
pip install parameterspace
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.8
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

### Setup environment

To install the package and its dependencies for development run:

```
poetry install
```

Optionally install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks to check code standards
before committing changes:

```
poetry run pre-commit install
```

### Running Tests

The tests are located in the `./tests` folder. The [pytest](https://pytest.org)
framework is used for running them. To run the tests:

```
poetry run pytest ./tests
```

### Building Documentation

To built documentation run from the repository root:

```
poetry run mkdocs build --clean
```

For serving it locally while working on the documentation run:

```
poetry run mkdocs serve
```

## Architectural Decision Records

### Parameter Names

**In the context of** naming parameters and using their name to fix them to constant
values or condition on them via `lambda` expressions,
**facing that** only valid Python variable names can be used in conditions, and that
fixing parameters that do not have a valid parameter name can only be done like
`fix(**{"invalid-variable:name": "const"})`
**we decided for** requiring all parameter names to be valid Python variable names
**to achieve** early failure and communication of that convention to avoid surprises
when fixing and using conditions down the line, accepting that this rules out common
parameter names like `lambda` and might require explicit translation between from and to
contexts that require incompatible names (e.g. predefined benchmarks).
